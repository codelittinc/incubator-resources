Codelitt Incubator Resources for Startups and Product Teams
===================

Processes, policies, and tools for startups. These are what we use at [Codelitt Incubator](http://www.codelitt.com), but they can be freely adapted to almost any startup. All open sourced and open for contribution. 

Check the different directories for different bits of information. Everything is edited in Markdown. 

Contributing: We welcome contributions. A good idea for your own company would be to maintain your own fork and branch that is customized to meet your needs. Any useful resources, tools, processes, etc can be pushed upstream to our master branch. For example, we maintain our current and in use policies on the versioned branches. 

You may find the version our company is using at: [v1.1.0 branch](https://github.com/codelittinc/incubator-resources/tree/v1.1.0)
