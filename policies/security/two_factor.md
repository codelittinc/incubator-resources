# 2 Factor Authentication on Github

Being a software development company, all parts of our work are in some way related with code.
A product built by us is made mainly by three parts:

 - Code
 - Design
 - Management
 - Documentation

With that said it is very important to make sure that all these parts are stored in an safe environment.
Accidents happen and even we are aware that no place is bullet proof, but we can do our best to minimize
the chance of something be seen by the wrong person or even to get lost.

Today we are using [Github](https://github.com) as a main tool for our process, there we store our code,
most part of our documentation and for a while now a great part of our management proccess, so it is very
importante to make sure that only allowed people will be able to access it.

Besides the main rule of: **do not share your account with anyone!**. We ask everyone that has access to
our Github repository to activate the two factor authentication.

What is two factor authentication? Also known as 2FA, it is an additional step in your sign in proccess.
After your usual login it will ask for a second number code that is going to be generated in your mobile
phone(or sent as a SMS), it depends on how you set it up.

Github offers a really good documentation about how to do it, you can check it [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-a-totp-mobile-app/), so if you are not part of the tech team don't be scared(Mr. Designer I'm looking at you).

Any doubt feel free to get in touch with the security responsible at Codelitt.
