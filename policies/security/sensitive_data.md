Let's talk about sensitive data and to do it we have only two rules:

 - Don't talk about sensitive data
 - Don't write down sensitive data

Jokes aside this is a sensitive topic(no pun intended), but first, what makes a data sensitive?

**Definition:** Sensitive information is data that must be protected from unauthorized access to
safeguard the privacy or security of an individual or organization.

There are three main types of sensitive information:

**Personal information:** Sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) is data that can be
traced back to an individual and that, if disclosed, could result in harm to that person.

**Business information:** Sensitive business information includes anything that poses a risk to the
company in question if discovered by a competitor or the general public. Such information includes
trade secrets, acquisition plans, financial data and supplier and customer information, among other
possibilities. With the ever-increasing amount of data generated by businesses, methods of protecting
corporate information from unauthorized access are becoming integral to corporate security. These
methods include metadata management and document sanitization.

**Classified information:** Classified information pertains to a government body and is restricted
according to level of sensitivity (for example, restricted, confidential, secret and top secret).

Now to a quick quiz:
What is a sensitive data?
  1. A server key
  2. Service access key
  3. A service name
  4. A Password

Prepared for the answer?

1. A server key is a sensitive data in most of the cases, for instance there are a lot of bots running
on the Github repositories (not made by Github) that searche for AWS keys so it can create linux servers
to farm bitcoins.

2. A service access key is something to be really concerned about. Writer's personal case: Once in 8 hours
48 Amazon servers where setup in my account and I got a 12 thousand dollars bill from because my access key
was stolen, at the time I didn't know about the best way to use it so I stored it in plain text, thanks
 to their awesome customer service the bill was turned down after explanation. Lesson learned.

2. Is a service name a sensitive data? It depends, what if it is the service that you use to secure all
your keys? If so then yes, it is. And what if it is a new product that you don't want the competition to
know about? yes again. If it is a public or common server that doesn't bring any harm to the company then no.
Some of the informations that a company make public may be a hidden bomb just waiting for someone to exploit it.

3. A password is always a sensitive data, it exists with that purpose.

So as you saw a sensitive data is something that may bring harm to your organization if it is gotten by the wrong
people, so what is the best way to keep an information secret? Don't write it down and make sure to
not be kidnapped, period.

Unfortunatelly in our everyday work we can not affort to not write some keys, can we memorize the following password?:

49AGvnuKd_ns@6^^ms64

Yes, we can and a good way to memorize it is using the letter per word technique:

4 9 APPLE GOLF visa nut usa KOREAN drip _ nut skype @ 6 ^ ^ music skype 6 4 ( provided by [passwordgenerator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/)

For those who can memorize it easily, congratulations! would you be able to do it for 20 different services
and for private keys with 2048 characters?
If you say yes again you are a hero, but if you work in Miami and I work in Brazil, how will you send it to
me if needed?

To have a sensitive data and how to keep it secure is a problem, to share it with the people who need it is
another harder.

In order to transfer sensitive data a few companies go with spliting the information in two and sending in two
different places so an attacker would have more problems, example:

To send the password: `49AGvnuKd_ns@6^^ms64` I can send `49AGvnuKd` to your email and `_ns@6^^ms64` to your phone
number as a SMS.

Is this way safe? It is safer than sending it in just one place, is it safe enough? Not really. If someone stole
your phone the password is stored there in plain text, so no deal.
A better option for tech people is to share it using PGP, which is completely covered in our [another article](#add-link)
Another is to use [Boveda](https://www.bovedahq.com/) which fills the gap between non tech people and safe data transference.

So when dealing with any sensitive data may it be storage or transference be aware of the risks and always make sure to do it
in the safest way possible, you never know which information in wrong people hands will turn down your organization,
or worse, your personal life.

Also to store sensitive data locally never do it in plain text, remember the amazon case I metioned before? The best way
is encrypting it with GPG, which is detailed explained in [this article](#add-link)
