Encryption
============

Encryption is to be used at all times when transmitting anything more sensitive than your first name. 

Why? Privacy and security. 

We work with a lot of 3rd parties. When it is unavoidable to send or receive info such as secret keys or passwords, prefer GPG encryption if the other party is capable. When they do not know how to use GPG, use a secure sending service like [Boveda.](https://www.bovedahq.com) Do not send sensitive information in plaintext under any circumstances.

### Email

PGP/GPG encrypted email is a must. Regardless of your distribution or OS, you'll need a encryption key manager, email client, and compatible PGP/GPG plugin.
