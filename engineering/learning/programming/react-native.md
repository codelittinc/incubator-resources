# React Native

React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand 
the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, 
state, and props. We have a [set of resources about React](./react-redux.md) to help you start on this. If you already 
know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components.
